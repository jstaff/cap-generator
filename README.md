> Connected App Platorm Generator (CAP Generator)

CAP generator creates and deploys web applications, just like creating backend applications from scratch linked with a heroku synchronizer to SalesForce platform easy and fast.


## **Previous requirements**

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

You must also have Angular/CLI to build web applications (We recommend having version ^8 for greater compatibility and stability).

```bash
npm i -g @angular/cli@8.3.8
```

Depending on Operating system you must have installed a package manager.
* MacOS or Linux install [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
* Windows install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

## Installation

Install generator-cap

```bash
npm install -g generator-cap
```

## Usage 

To generate a new project using CAP just run:

```bash
yo cap
```

It will prompt you a series of question regarding to your project

## Subgenerators
This generator automatically includes the sub generators based on the user answers. 
For more detail about how to use each module we recommend go through their documentation

> For now all subgenerators works only with the main generator, not alone.
> Future release will have working this as completly standalone subgenerator
