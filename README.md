## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-cap using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-cap
```

## Usage 

To generate a new project using CAP just run: 

```bash
yo cap
```

It will prompt you a series of question regarding to your project

## Subgenerators
This generator automatically includes the sub generators based on the user answers. 
For more detail about how to use each module we recommend go through their documentation

> For now all subgenerators works only if you use the main generator which will ask the information the subgenerator needs to work correctly.
> Future release will have working this as completly standalone subgenerator
